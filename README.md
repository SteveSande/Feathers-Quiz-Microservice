# Feathers-Quiz-Microservice #
Adapted from <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y33WCVkLwc'>Traversy Media</a>.

This project is the foundation of a multiple choice quiz delivery service.
It was written to gain familiarity with web dev technologies.
The user has CRUD access through an admin page.
Only admin functionality has been implemented thus far because that fulfilled the main learning goals and timeline of the project.

The repo is hosted at https://feathers-quiz-service.netlify.app/.

To run locally use Live Server extension.
